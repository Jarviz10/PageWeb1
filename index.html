                    Currently I am taking a course for a certificate in Java, I have learned some new things that I did not know.
                    
                    <br/>The programming language where I have more experience is in Java, since I used it since high school and in university 
                    <br/>I reinforced my knowledge by applying it to projects.

                In the future I would like to obtain certifications and specialize in various programming languages, I want to learn more about css and Javascrip and learn more about web pages, since it is something that I don't know much about.
